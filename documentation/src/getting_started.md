# Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running the fuzzer for the first time. We'll cover the basic steps needed to configure the fuzzer and execute a simple fuzzing session.

## Overview

To get started with the fuzzer, you'll need to:

1. **Configure the Fuzzer:** Set up the `FuzzerConfig` with your desired options.
2. **Define Target Functions:** Create one or more functions that the fuzzer will test.
3. **Initialize the Fuzzer:** Create an instance of the `Fuzzer` and add your target functions.
4. **Run the Fuzzer:** Execute the fuzzing session and monitor progress.

In the next section, we'll walk through a quick start example that demonstrates these steps.
